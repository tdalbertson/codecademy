The Forest of Lost Echoes
Setting:
You wake up in a dense, eerie forest. The air is thick with mist, and you have no memory of how you got here. A faint voice calls your name, echoing through the trees. You must navigate the forest and uncover its secrets while deciding whether to trust the voice.

Beginning:
You hear a voice whisper:
"Come to me, and you will be free."

You see three paths ahead:

The Lighted Path: Glimmers of light guide this trail, but the forest grows eerily quiet as you approach.
The Riverbank: A gentle stream flows nearby. It seems calm, but you sense movement beneath the water.
The Dark Tunnel: A shadowy, overgrown tunnel looms ahead, its entrance shaped like a gaping mouth.
The Choices and Endings:
1. The Lighted Path
You follow the glimmers of light, leading to a small clearing. A pedestal sits in the center, with a glowing crystal atop it.
Choices:
Touch the crystal: The crystal bonds with you, giving you strange powers. You become the guardian of the forest.

Ending 1: The Guardian
You protect the forest from those who seek to harm it, but you are bound to it forever.
Ignore the crystal and move on: The forest grows darker, and you become lost forever in its depths.

Ending 2: Eternal Wanderer
You are trapped, wandering endlessly, hearing the echoes of the voice but never escaping.
2. The Riverbank
At the river, you see a figure in the water beckoning you to approach.
Choices:
Trust the figure: You enter the water and are pulled into an underwater kingdom, where you are crowned ruler.

Ending 3: The River King/Queen
You live in peace under the water but can never return to the surface.
Refuse and follow the river downstream: You stumble upon a hidden village of survivors who help you escape the forest.

Ending 4: The Survivor
You return to the world, wiser and forever changed by your adventure.
3. The Dark Tunnel
Inside the tunnel, the voice grows louder, and you come face to face with its source: a spectral being claiming to be your guide.
Choices:
Follow the spirit: It leads you to an ancient treasure but vanishes, leaving you to fend off a cursed guardian.

Ending 5: The Cursed Treasure
You escape with the treasure, but you are haunted by the guardian for the rest of your days.
Refuse the spirit's help: The tunnel collapses, but you find a hidden exit that leads you back to safety.

Ending 6: The Lone Escape
You escape the forest, but the voice continues to call to you in your dreams.
